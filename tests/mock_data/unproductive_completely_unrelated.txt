Subject: My Favorite Steam Games

Hello,

I know this might not be the right place, but I wanted to share my favorite games on Steam with you. I’ve been playing a lot of strategy games like Civilization VI and Total War: Warhammer, and I also enjoy smaller indie games like Hades and Hollow Knight. I usually play in the evenings after work and I think gaming is a great way to relax.

Sometimes I wonder what games financial professionals play when they have time off — do you also enjoy simulations or more casual stuff? Personally, I can’t wait for the next release of Baldur’s Gate expansions!

Best,
Lucas
